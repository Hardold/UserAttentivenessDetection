# UserAttentivenessDetection
An open source OpenCV project for Eye Center Detection and Gaze Estimation

##Getting Started
The project uses OpenCV library and the Snakuscule algorithm for capturing the eye center location. The eye center location and its relative position with respect to the eye corners can provide an estimate of the direction of the gaze. The code currently operates only on frontal faces and does not provide any gaze information. Check out the code and compile under Visual Studio to run it. Wearing spectacles may reduce the accuracy of the algortihm.

####Prerequisites
To use the above code, please install OpenCV for Visual Studio as explained here: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_visual_studio_Opencv/windows_visual_studio_Opencv.html

Note: The code in the repository has been created using OpenCV 3.0.0 which has a slightly different installation procedure.

####License
Commercial use of the code without prior consent is not allowed.
